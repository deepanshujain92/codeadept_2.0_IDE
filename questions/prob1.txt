<h2>1. Two Sum</h2>
                    <p>Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.</p><p>You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.</p>
                    <b>Example:</b>
                    <pre>Given A = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because A[0] + A[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
                    </pre>
